# NBA-All-Star-ML

This project explores using Machine Learning techniques to explore whether or not we can accurately predict a player being selected as an NBA All-Star. To do so, I imported data from the past 10 NBA seasons (2008 - 2018) and used player's statistics as the features. The data folder contains the raw data from each season that was imported from [http://basketball-reference.com] as well as the final cleaned data set I used to conduct my analysis.

For this project, I decided to use three supervised learning algorithms: Support Vector Clustering, Binomial Naive Bayes Classifiers, and Random Forests. All results were produced using the sci-kit learn library and are documented in the ipynb file. 

Jupyter Notebook is needed to run the ipynb file, and a py file is also availble in the respository.
